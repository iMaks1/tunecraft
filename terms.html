          While we aim to create something deeply moving and meaningful, the final result may differ from what you initially imagined. As with any services, interpretations and emotional responses can vary. We do not warrant that the appearance, quality, or emotional impact of any products or services purchased by you will meet your expectations or be the same as depicted or rendered in our website. All descriptions of products are subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time and may limit the quantities of any products that we offer to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis.

          SECTION 3 - ORDERS
         </h2>
         <p class="mb-4">
          When you place an order, you are making an offer to purchase. TuneCraft reserves the right to accept or decline your order for any reason at its discretion. Your order is not accepted until TuneCraft confirms acceptance. We must receive and process your payment before your order is accepted. Please review your order carefully before submitting, as TuneCraft may be unable to accommodate cancellation requests after an order is accepted. In the event that we do not accept, make a change to, or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e‑mail provided at the time the order was made.
         </p>

          SECTION 4 - PRICES AND BILLING
         </h2>
         <p class="mb-4">
          Prices, discounts and promotions are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product or service will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation email. Unless otherwise expressly stated, posted prices do not include taxes, shipping, handling, customs or import charges.
         </p>
         <p class="mb-4">
          We may offer, from time to time, promotions on the Services that may affect pricing and that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms. If there is a conflict between the terms for a promotion and these Terms, the promotion terms will govern.

          SECTION 5 - DELIVERY
         </h2>
         <p class="mb-4">
          We provide access to purchased services by making an access link available through the Services and may also send a courtesy notification to the email address you provide. It is your responsibility to ensure that the email address you provide is accurate and capable of receiving our messages. Delivery is complete when the access link is made available, whether or not you open the email, click the link, or play the services, and whether or not any email notification is received (including if the email address provided is incorrect or inaccessible, or messages are filtered or bounce). Upon delivery, responsibility for access, and the risk of loss or failure to access the product passes to you. This includes circumstances where you do not open the email, misplace it, or where delivery fails due to an incorrect or inaccessible email address provided by you. Please check your spam or junk folders if you do not see your delivery. Access links may be time-limited, changed, or disabled without notice. We do not promise ongoing hosting, archiving, backup, re-delivery, or continued availability. Delivery times are estimates only and are not guaranteed, and we are not responsible for delays or access issues caused by events outside our control or by your devices, software, internet service, or email settings.

         <p class="mb-4">
          If you submit, upload, post, email, or otherwise transmit any ideas, suggestions, feedback, reviews, proposals, plans, or other content (collectively, "Feedback"), you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute and display such Feedback in any medium for any purpose, including for commercial use. We may, for example, use our rights under this license to operate, provide, evaluate, enhance, improve and promote the Services and to perform our obligations and exercise our rights under the Terms of Service.

         <p class="mb-4">
          You also represent and warrant that: (i) you own or have all necessary rights to all Feedback; (ii) you have disclosed any compensation or incentives received in connection with your submission of Feedback; and (iii) your Feedback will comply with these Terms. We are and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain your Feedback in confidence; (2) to pay compensation for your Feedback; or (3) to respond to your Feedback.

          We may, but are under no obligation to, monitor, pre-screen, edit, publish, or remove any Feedback. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to decline to publish or to remove Feedback at any time for any reason, including if we determine it is unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene, misleading, infringing, spam, otherwise objectionable, or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms, or if we determine it is off-topic, low-quality, or not aligned with our tone, brand, or mission. We may exercise these rights without notice.
         </p>
         <p class="mb-4">
          Feedback reflects the opinions of the individuals who provide it and not necessarily those of TuneCraft. Publication of Feedback does not constitute our endorsement, and we do not independently verify its accuracy.

         <p>
          You agree that your Feedback will not violate any right of any third-party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, personality or other personal or proprietary right. You further agree that your Feedback will not contain libelous or otherwise unlawful, abusive or obscene Feedback, or contain any computer virus or other malware that could in any way affect the operation of the Services or any related website. You may not use a false email address, pretend to be someone other than yourself, or otherwise mislead us or third-parties as to the origin of any Feedback. You are solely responsible for any Feedback you make and its accuracy. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Feedback posted by you or any third-party.

         </p>
         <p>
          We will notify you of any indemnifiable claim, provided that a failure to promptly notify will not relieve you of your obligations unless you are materially prejudiced. We may control the defense and settlement of such claim at your expense, including choice of counsel, but will not settle any claim requiring non-monetary obligations from you without your consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). You will cooperate in the defense of indemnified claims, including by providing relevant documents.

         <p>
          These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to them or the Services are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where TuneCraft is headquartered, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. For matters not subject to arbitration, the state and federal courts located in that jurisdiction have exclusive jurisdiction and venue, and you and TuneCraft consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. To the maximum extent permitted by law, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act; the arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve disputes regarding arbitrability. CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU AND TUNECRAFT WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. Either party may bring an individual claim in small claims court, and either party may seek temporary or permanent injunctive relief in court to protect intellectual property or prevent unauthorized access or use of the Services. Arbitration may be conducted by video/teleconference or, at your request, in your county of residence. In the event of mass filings, the AAA's mass-arbitration/bellwether procedures will apply and remaining claims may be stayed. This section survives termination.

         </h2>
         <p class="mb-4">
          Because our products and services are custom and digital in nature, all sales are generally final once work has begun or delivery has occurred. Cancellation requests must be submitted promptly to support@prayersong.com, and may be approved or declined at our sole discretion based on the status of your order.
         </p>
         <p class="mb-4">
          Refunds are considered at our sole discretion. Add-ons, rush/priority delivery, and other upgrades are non-refundable once purchased.
         </p>
         <p class="mb-4">
          If we are unable to deliver substantially as described in your order due to an error on our part, we may, at our option, re‑deliver the digital product or provide a refund. Any approved refund will be issued to the original payment method; processing times vary by provider. Payment processor fees, third‑party production, or fulfillment costs may be non‑refundable and may be deducted from any refund where permitted by law.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you believe a charge is incorrect, contact us first at support@prayersong.com so we can help resolve it. Initiating a chargeback without contacting us may delay resolution; we reserve the right to dispute chargebacks and to suspend accounts associated with abusive or fraudulent disputes.
