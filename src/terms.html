                    <p>Welcome to TuneCraft! The terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to TuneCraft. TuneCraft operates this website, including all related information, content, features, tools, products and services in order to provide you, the customer, with a curated experience (the "Services").</p>
                    <p>The below terms and conditions, together with any policies referenced herein (these "Terms of Service" or "Terms") describe your rights and responsibilities when you use the Services.</p>
                    <p>Please read these Terms of Service carefully, as they include important information about your legal rights and cover areas such as warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability.</p>

As with any services, interpretations and emotional responses can vary. We do not warrant that the appearance, quality, or emotional impact of any products or services purchased by you will meet your expectations or be the same as depicted or rendered in our website. All descriptions of products are subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time and may limit the quantities of any products that we offer to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                    <h2>SECTION 5 - DELIVERY</h2>
                    <p>We provide access to purchased services by making an access link available through the Services and may also send a courtesy notification to the email address you provide. It is your responsibility to ensure that the email address you provide is accurate and capable of receiving our messages. Delivery is complete when the access link is made available, whether or not you open the email, click the link, or play the services, and whether or not any email notification is received (including if the email address provided is incorrect or inaccessible, or messages are filtered or bounce). Upon delivery, responsibility for access, and the risk of loss or failure to access the product passes to you. This includes circumstances where you do not open the email, misplace it, or where delivery fails due to an incorrect or inaccessible email address provided by you. Please check your spam or junk folders if you do not see your delivery. Access links may be time-limited, changed, or disabled without notice. We do not promise ongoing hosting, archiving, backup, re-delivery, or continued availability. Delivery times are estimates only and are not guaranteed, and we are not responsible for delays or access issues caused by events outside our control or by your devices, software, internet service, or email settings.</p>
